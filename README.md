# CSE423/424 ASU Capstone - Benchmark: First Responder Tracking System
#### Members: Patrick Archer, Joshua Owens, Haoyu Xu, Jason Zellers

## Motivation
Firefighters and first responders commonly experience uncontrolled chaos on their jobs as they rush into burning buildings to save lives and property. Many frequently navigate areas with poor visibility and accessibility, and general awareness of their surrounding squadmates can be quite limited. *Existing methods of tracking firefighter location provide little to no usable or reliable data. This puts firefighters in a great amount of risk.* Additionally, without real-time knowledge of first responder locations, command central encounters great difficulty in trying to direct personel throughout a scene. For example, directing a squad towards the last known location of a civilian essentially only entails verbal directions via radio. This is not nearly reliable or efficient enough for use by individuals trying to traverse a dangerous environment in a limited amount of time.

**The goal of this project is to provide real-time X, Y, and Z-axis locations for individual on-scene first responders without the use of GPS or an internet connection.**
Improved methods of tracking first responder location would promote safety by providing constant and reliable information regarding individual locations in real-time. Promoting better coordination and teamwork on the job by providing accurate location data would allow first responders to minimize the potential risk to their lives and the lives of civilians in need.

This system is not to be entirely specific to firefighters. It is capable of being utilized by other types of first responders, such as law enforcement and EMS. Coordination and hyper-awareness of every detail on the scene is critical to ensure the safety of everyone involved.  For example, when police or SWAT are actively securing an area, knowledge of the exact count of officials on a scene and where their precise locations are in X,Y, and Z-axes is massively beneficial.
